/**
 * rf.Sparks jQuery plugin
 * 
 * @version		1.0 (05/22/2009)
 * @author 		Matt Kirman <http://mattkirman.com> <http://twitter.com/mattkirman>
 * @requires 	jQuery v1.3 or later (May work with previous versions. Not tested)

 *
 * 
 * This version is far from perfect as it is fairly resource hungry when you set
 * the number of sparks to a fairly high number. This may be sorted in later releases.
 * 
 *
 * Usage: $('#container').sparks();
 *
